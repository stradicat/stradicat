### Hi there 👋

<!--
**stradicat/stradicat** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I ~~’m currently~~ was working on mobile development (Android + Kotlin / KMP)
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30353238/182044656-c8a97ec0-bb80-4905-ad15-29a3864eaee2.png) Enthusiast Emacs + Spacemacs user.
- 🌱 Also, I may keep on learning Rust, probably Emacs LISP ~~soon so I can collaborate in extensions development~~.
- 👯 I’m ~~looking~~ no longer ~~to collaborate~~ collaborating on native Android applications for phones with Kotlin.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've switched to goldsmithing and lutherie, effectively leaving the IT industry at its worst job market in the past couple of decades.
However, I wish you all every success, and will still keep an eye on projects and tools that do a thing very well.
